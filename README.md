Person Application:

Scenario: You are a backend developer and need to create an application to handle 3 types of persons: Person, Student, SalariedStudent.

Your application should do the fallowing:
- A hierarchy of 3 derived classes will be implemented in c++: Person, Student and SalariedStudent that will implement inheritance.
- Class variables will be private and public get and set methods will be defined for accessing them
- A display method will be defined (void display()) which will have the same name in all classes but will have different behavior as it is virtual
- Comparison methods will be implemented: which person is older and if he is a man or a woman
- The implementation of a constructor, copy constructor and destructor is required
- Validation will be done for the data retrieved by the set methods (bool setName), the name cannot be null
- Each class will have at least one Friend function
- An abstract class will be defined, which will be used by an instantiable class
- Exceptions will be defined (salary cannot be zero or negative) in the implemented code that will be caught and treated
